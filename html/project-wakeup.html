        <p>The Three Thing Game is a 24-hour Game Jam, hosted by the Computer Science department at the University of
            Hull. It takes place twice a year. Teams are given three random words which are to be somehow implemented
            into their game.</p>
        <p>My team consisted of 4 people: Anthony Beacock (myself), Jakob Scrivener, Dean Barnard and Reece Giles (who
            stayed for the Friday night), and our words were “Hopping”, “Sheeple” and “Building”.</p>

        <!-- TABLE OF TEAM MEMBERS -->
        <table style="width:100%">

        <p>After some thought, we decided on creating a game called “Wake Up!”, in which the main character is a sheep
            that does not conform to his stereotype. The term “Sheeple” referred to people who follow the crowd (like
            sheep) and aren’t individual in any way.</p>
        <p>The first part of the game would be a 2D side-scroller platform type game, in which the character has to
            “hop” from building to building, whilst being chased by the Sheeple. There would also be various “sheeple”
            stood on some of the rooftops, waiting to kill you. In order to continue unharmed, one must shoot
            projectiles at them. These projectiles are “Bah’s” which suggests that the character is “Spitting Bah’s”…
            (Pun Intended!).</p>
        <p>The levels were tile based. They were initially created by Reece and then later tweaked by Jake. An attempt
            was made to match the required “hops” between buildings, to the music that a friend of the team (Kieren
            Goodwin-Green) had made.</p>
        <p>The mechanics behind the boss level were created by myself. I combined these with the artwork that Jake had
            previously created.</p>
        <p>Most of the Boss’ movement consisted of sine waves. One controlled the horizontal movement of the whole
            body, making it move left and right. Each arm was also controlled by its own sin wave, which made both of
            them move separately and vertically. This gave the illusion that the boss was more intelligent than it
            actually was. This very basic AI also made the boss a little more unpredictable, as it would be different
            every time a user played the game. Each arm had a health of 25 hits, which meant that one would have to aim
            and attack more individual parts of the boss’ body, rather than shooting aimlessly.</p>
        <p>Each sin wave used in the game was limited by using variables such as magnitude and frequency. This allowed
            me to adjust the speed and distance of each object the sin waves controlled.</p>
        <p>A short video showing various parts of the game has been included below.</p>

        <p>The creation of this game challenged various skills, both general and technical. Some of the more general of
            these included creativity, teamwork, working under pressure. Some of the more technical skills were the use
            of the Unity Engine and Programming in C# language.</p>
        <p>As always, I enjoyed the Three Thing Game this year, as it was a great opportunity to improve and strengthen
            skills, whilst having fun in a laid back, friendly but competitive environment.</p>
        <p>Thank you very much for reading,
            Tony.</p>
