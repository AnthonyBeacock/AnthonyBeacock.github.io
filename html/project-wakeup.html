    <section class="text">

        <p>The Three Thing Game is a 24-hour Game Jam, hosted by the Computer Science department at the University of
            Hull. It takes place twice a year. Teams are given three random words which are to be somehow implemented
            into their game.</p>

        <p>My team consisted of 4 people: Anthony Beacock (myself), Jakob Scrivener, Dean Barnard and Reece Giles (who
            stayed for the Friday night), and our words were “Hopping”, “Sheeple” and “Building”.</p>
